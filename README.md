## 🎯 Project Overview
TalentScout Pro is an advanced AI-powered hiring assistant designed to revolutionize technical candidate screening for recruitment agencies. Built with Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model and deployed on AWS EC2, this intelligent chatbot automates the initial screening process while maintaining a human-like interaction quality.

The application serves as a virtual technical recruiter, capable of conducting complete screening interviews from start to finish. It combines natural conversation flow with structured technical assessment to evaluate candidates effectively while providing recruiters with comprehensive evaluation reports.
